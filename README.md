# Step to create your own repository branch

First, clone this repository to your computer and switch to dev-main branch
```
git clone git@github.com:xdai-dlgvv/tracking_codes.git

Second, create your own branch from this dev_main branch. The new branch is your own name.
```
git checkout -b <your-name>
```
Now, its your own branch, then start coding work in this directory.

# Step to upload your code

When a new algorithm coding work is started, it is necessary for you to create a new folder in root path with the algorithm name, such as MOSSE, DCFï¼Œetc.
Note: If you write that algorithm in other folder, please copy or move it to your own branch folder.

When it is finished, add your new files and folders to git, then commit and push with a short message.
```
git add <your-file>
git commit
git push o
```
